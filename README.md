## Resources

### Reading

I like reading so why not reading books? Here are some French books I would like to read during 2024:

- [ ] *La Planète des Singe* by *Pierre Boulle*
- [ ] *Voyage au Centre de la Terre* by *Jules Verne*
- [ ] *Le Bal des Papillons* by *Hervé Vilard*
- [ ] *L'âme Seule* by *Hervé Vilard*
- [ ] *Du Lierre dans les Arbres* by *Hervé Vilard*

### Speaking

Here are some tools/resources that I use/gonna use to delve deeper into the French language, some of these are paid services but they also have a free version.

#### YouTube

Although French may have a *strange* pronunciation from the point of view of some people learning the language, there are some pretty good resources (free and paid).

I found an interesting [French pronunciation playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBZcHkPESuK-2a6SHfP45aJSGp8a3dxwP) on YouTube from the Language Resource Center at the University of Michigan.

#### Pimsleur

I've used Pimsleur in the past to learn the Portuguese language, so I think this is definitely my way to go.

#### Busuu

I've used the Busuu app to improve my Portuguese and I'm definitely using it to learn French.
